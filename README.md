# Housing Data Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing sales data. The dataset includes information on various features such as ocean proximity, median house value, households, population, total bedrooms, total rooms, housing median age, latitude, and longitude. The purpose of this project is to explore the relationships and patterns within the dataset to gain insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:

- **longitude**: Represents the longitude coordinate of a specific area.
- **latitude**: Represents the latitude coordinate of a specific area.
- **housing_median_age**: Refers to the median age of houses in a specific area.
- **total_rooms**: Represents the total number of rooms in a specific area.
- **total_bedrooms**: Indicates the total number of bedrooms in a specific area.
- **population**: Represents the total population in a specific area.
- **households**: Refers to the number of households in a specific area.
- **median_house_value**: Represents the median value of houses in a specific area.
- **ocean_proximity**: Indicates the proximity of the housing to the ocean.

## Questions to Explore

To gain insights from the dataset, the following questions will be explored:

1. What is the median house value in different ocean proximities?
2. How does the number of households vary based on the ocean proximity?
3. What is the population distribution across different ocean proximities?
4. What is the average number of total bedrooms in each ocean proximity category?
5. How does the number of total rooms differ based on the ocean proximity?
6. What is the median age of housing in different ocean proximities?
7. How does latitude affect the median house value?
8. How does longitude impact the number of households?
9. What is the relationship between median house value and population?
10. How does the total number of bedrooms change with latitude and longitude?
11. What is the average number of total rooms in each housing median age group?
12. How does the median house value vary with the total number of rooms?
13. What is the distribution of median house value across different latitude ranges?
14. How does the population change with the housing median age?
15. What is the impact of latitude and longitude on the total number of bedrooms?

## Getting Started

To run the analysis on the sales data, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-analysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the analysis script `analyze_sales_data.py`.
4. The script will generate visualizations and provide insights based on the questions explored.

Feel free to modify the analysis script to further investigate the dataset or tweak the visualizations to suit your needs.

## Results

The results of the analysis, including visualizations and insights, can be found in the `results` folder. Each question explored will have a corresponding result file containing the findings.
